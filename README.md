  ## Description
    This CLI application will allow the user to create an employee database. The user is then able to add new employees, add new roles, add new departments, update a current employees role using the CLI.

  ## Installation
    You will first need to fork the repository over to your own machine. Then you will need to run --npm i-- in the CLI to install the necessary packages. Next, you will need to run --mysql -u root -p--. Then you will need to enter your mysql password. Once you have completed the above, you will then need to create the database. While in mysql in the CLI, navigate to the correct folder and enter --source db/schema.sql--. Now you will need to seed the database with data. Run the command --source db/seeds.sql--. Once you have seeded the database you are ready to start the server. You will need to enter --node server.js-- in the CLI to start the server. From there, you can then access the Employee Database and update any necessary information.
